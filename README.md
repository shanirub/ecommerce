# KoopaKart
### An E-commerce System Inspired by the Super Mario Universe

## Description
KoopaKart is a full-fledged e-commerce solution designed for customers to handle their orders and for staff to maintain products and user accounts. To make the mundane task of buying everyday items like bread and milk more engaging, this project places its operations in the whimsical Super Mario universe. In this world, products are represented as stars and mushrooms, while users take on the roles of brave plumbers and their helpful toads.

This project was created for educational purposes. My main priorities include:
1. **Best Practices**: Adhering to conventions and using industry-standard packages.
2. **Learning New Technologies**: Prioritizing learning over quick solutions. While this e-commerce system could have been built more simply, my goal is to explore and understand new technologies.
3. **Clarity and Accessibility**: Although I am the sole developer, I aim to document everything clearly to ensure that anyone can understand my ideas and implementations.
